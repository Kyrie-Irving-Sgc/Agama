This file lists the most important updates in Agama (in reverse chronological order);
breaking changes in API are listed at the end.

April 2020:
Optimized computation of DF moments for the case of a composite DF, when output is requested for
each DF component separately.

March 2020:
Added Python routines for celestial coordinate transformations, which perform some of the tasks
provided by the astropy.coordinates framework (the routines in Agama are less general but faster).

January 2020:
The Monte Carlo code Raga is extended to multiple species and provided as part of AMUSE interface.

December 2019:
Observationally-driven Schwarzschild modelling framework is published under the name Forstand;
added examples and documentation.

May 2019:
Significant speedup in quadratic optimization (part of Schwarzschild modelling framework).

March 2019:
Added anisotropic spherical DFs constructed via the Cuddeford-Osipkov-Merritt inversion technique.

May 2018:
Added axisymmetric Jeans models.

Winter 2018:
General cleanup, script for automatic installation, publicly announced together with the code paper.

Autumn 2017:
Added and improved action-based DFs (QuasiSpherical, QuasiIsothermal, Exponential);
improved the multidimensional sampling routine.

Summer 2017:
Augmented the Schwarzschild module with the observational kinematic constraints in the form of LOSVDs.

May 2017:
The core functionality of SMILE - construction of Schwarzschild orbit-superposition models
for the given density and potential (without any observational constraints) - is ported into Agama.
The top-level workflow is implemented in Python, while the computationally heavy parts -- in C++.

April 2017:
Further development of the PhaseFlow code: multiple components, more accurate finite-element solver.

January 2017:
Ported the stellar-dynamical Monte Carlo code Raga (which, in turn, was based on SMILE) into
Agama framework.

November 2016:
Added a first version of the PhaseFlow Fokker-Planck code.

October 2016:
Added reference documentation.

Summer 2016:
Extended Python interface, added Fortran, NEMO and AMUSE interfaces.

November 2015:
Added the framework for iterative construction of self-consistent models specified by action-based DFs.

September 2015:
First public announcement at the Gaia Challenge workshop.
By this time, the Agama library already has a Python interface and a number of tests/example programs.

Summer 2015:
Various parts of SMILE are ported into Agama: potentials, orbit integration routines, splines.

June 2015:
The Agama C++ library is born by reimplementing several earlier routines for action computation
written by James Binney and Jason Sanders (now known as the TACT toolbox).

Pre-2015:
The predecessor of Agama was the SMILE code for orbit analysis and Schwarzschild modelling.
It contained many of the aspects that later were incorporated into Agama:
an extensive collection of potentials (including earlier implementations of Multipole and CylSpline),
orbit integration and analysis routines (frequency analysis, Lyapunov exponents, frequency maps),
construction of orbit-superposition models, a graphical interface based on Qt, Python and NEMO interfaces.
Some of this functionality is not yet ported to Agama.

-----------
API Changes

April 2020:
[C++, Python]  interface for computing DF moments has been modified to provide an option
for treating all components of a composite DF separately.

January 2020:
[C++]  interface for dealing with spherical isotropic models and relaxation coefficients
changed to accommodate the possibility of working with a spectrum of stellar masses.
[C++]  orbit integration, in particular integrateTraj(), can optionally store the orbit
at every timestep, not just at regular intervals of time as before. Accordingly,
the type of returned array changed to also contain timestamps for each point.
[C++]  interface for N-body snapshot input/output has been cleaned up.

March 2019:
[C++, Python]  QuasiIsotropic DF renamed to QuasiSpherical, because it can now represent
anisotropic spherical systems.
